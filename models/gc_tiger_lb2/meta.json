    "description": "Participants in the TIGER challenge will have to develop computer algorithms to analyze H&E-stained whole-slide images of breast cancer histopathology, to perform three tasks:  detection of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which are the main types of cells considered as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; segmentation of invasive tumor and tumor-associated stroma, which are the main tissue compartments considered when identifying relevant regions for the TILs; compute an automated TILs score, one score per slide, based on the output of detection and segmentation.",
